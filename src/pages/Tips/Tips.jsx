      <h2 className="section-title">Introduction:</h2>
      <p>
        Managing time during preparation — and during the exam itself — can make or break your CAT score.
        It’s not just about how much you know; it’s about how efficiently you apply that knowledge under pressure.
        Many bright students lose marks not because they didn’t know the answer, but because they spent too
        much time on tough questions, panicked under time pressure, or couldn’t plan their preparation well.
        The good news? Time management is a skill you can learn and master — with the right approach and consistent practice.
        <br /><br />
        Here are five proven strategies straight from CAT toppers and Tathagat mentors that can help you maximize every minute.
      </p>

      <h3 className="tip-heading">1. Prioritize High-Impact Topics</h3>
      <p>
        Not all topics are created equal. Some areas consistently carry more weight in the exam —
        mastering these gives you a better return on your time investment.
        <br />✔ Identify the most important topics based on past CAT papers (e.g., Arithmetic, Algebra in Quant; Reading Comprehension in Verbal).
        <br />✔ Devote more time to mastering these before moving to less-weighted areas.
        <br /><strong>Tip:</strong> <br />
        Create a simple checklist and update it weekly to track your command over high-impact topics.
      </p>

      <h3 className="tip-heading">2. Train Early with Full-Length Mocks</h3>
      <p>
        Mocks are your best friends.
        <br />✔ Start taking full-length mock tests early — ideally 3–4 months before the exam.
        <br />✔ Analyze your performance: look beyond scores; check where you spent too much time, where you guessed, and where you skipped.
        <br /><strong>Important:</strong> <br />
        Mock tests should simulate real exam conditions — same time slots, same environment, and no distractions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="tip-heading">3. Master the Art of Skipping</h3>
      <p>
        Time management inside the exam hall is all about smart decision-making.
        <br />✔ Don’t get emotionally attached to questions.
        <br />✔ If a question looks lengthy, tricky, or confusing in the first few seconds, skip it and move on.
        <br />✔ Come back later if time permits — after all, CAT rewards accuracy, not ego!
        <br /><strong>Remember:</strong> <br />
        Sometimes, not attempting a tough question is a winning move.

        <h3>4. Study in Small, Intense Bursts</h3>
        <p>
          Long study hours without focus can drain your energy without real progress.
          <br />✔ Instead, use techniques like Pomodoro (25 minutes focused study + 5 minutes break).
          <br />✔ Break your day into 2–3 focused sessions — Quant in the morning, Verbal and LRDI in the evening.
          <br /><strong>Example Routine:</strong>
          <br />• 8 AM – 10 AM: Quantitative Aptitude practice
          <br />• 5 PM – 6:30 PM: Verbal Ability practice
          <br />• 9 PM – 10 PM: Mock Analysis
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="final-tip">
        <h3>5. Build Exam-Day Endurance</h3>
        <p>
          CAT is a 2-hour mental marathon. You must train your brain for sustained focus.
          <br />✔ Practice sitting for long periods without distractions.
          <br />✔ Take back-to-back mocks closer to the exam day to build stamina.
          <br /><strong>Pro Tip:</strong>
          <br />Simulate the emotional pressure too — treat mocks seriously so you get used to performing under stress.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="final-conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Time management isn’t a trick you pull out on exam day — it’s a habit you build over months of smart preparation.
          <br />
          Start applying these strategies now. Break your studies into achievable goals. Practice under pressure. Stay consistent.
          <br />
          By exam day, time will no longer be your enemy — it will be your secret weapon.
